int fun(int *k) {
    *k += 4;                    // *10 +=4 
    return 3 * (*k) - 1;     // 3*(10+4)-1
}

void main() {
    
    
    int i = 10, j = 10, sum1, sum2;
    sum1 = (i / 2) + fun(&i);  // 
    printf("sum1= %d\n", sum1);
    
    sum2 = fun(&j) + (j / 2); // 
    printf("sum2= %d\n",sum2);
}

/*Explanation of results:
    sum1 = (10 / 2) + 3*(10+4)-1  
         = 5 + 41
         = 46  
         
    sum2 = 3*(10+4)-1 + 14/2
         = 41 + 7 
         = 48
    Since it is evaluated from left to right, i/2 is seen as (10/2).
    Because the variable J is passed by reference after the function call, 
    its value is changed to 10 + 4. This explains the change.

If there was no precedence: 
    The answer would differ if one evaluated from right to left. 
     sum 2 would be 46 and sum 1 would be 48.
