<h2>Activiy 7: Cascading Style Sheets </h2>

<ol type="1">

  <li>Headings</li>
	<p> The school name should be in a large heading tag such as h1. 
	It is the most important title. There would also be subheadings underneath the main school name. 
	The subheading would be h2 for the general school's contact information ( i.e. school email, school phone number) 
	Tag:< h1 - h6 > 
	
	
	</p> 
		
  <li>Images</li>
	<p> There would be images of the school's logo to the top-left corner, a picture of the school,and pictures of the school's faculty along with their names.
	If there is a newsletter portion in the school's website, then there would be pictures of those events.
	There would also be an image of the bus's routes. There would be a image that contains the entire school's calendar events 
	( ie shows when school breaks are, when there are holidays,etc). 
	Tag: < img src="school.gif" alt="schoolalt" width="42" height="42">
	
	</p>
	
  <li>HyperLinks</li>
	 <p> There would be a need to hyperlink specific teacher's syllabus. There would also be a need to hyperlink to specific teacher's pages. There would also 
	 need to be a link to go back to the main page. 
		Tag: < a href="url"> link text< / a >
	
	 </p>
	 
	
  <li>Tables</li>
	<p> There would be three columns: Teacher, Subject, and a hyperlink to the specific teacher's syllabus. The rows would depend on the number of faculty in the school.
		There would be another table containing bus information. There would be three columns ( Bus #, Arrival Time, and Departure Time). The rows would depend on 
		the number of buses in the  school system. On the specific teacher's page, there would be another table with two columns ( Week of 00/00/0000 and homework). 
		Tag: < table id="Faculty" < tr> < th>Teacher < th> subject < th>hyperlinkToTheirPage </ tr> </ table>
	
	</p>
  
  <li>Paragraphs using P tag</li>
		<p> This would be used for whatever text they needed in terms of descriptions. Some school website's have a history of the school page. This tag could be used for that 
		purpose as well. </p>
		Tag: < p > < / p > 
		
  <li>Div</li>
		This would help with placing where the text are. ( It helps with the padding.) 
		Tag: < div > < / div >
		
  <li>Title</li>
		For the school's tab on a browser, it would need to say the name of the school. 
		Tag: <title> </title> 
		
  <li>Bulleted List</li>
		It would be helpful to list out the exam dates.
		Tag: < ul> < li > < / ul >  OR < ol  > < li >  < / ol > (unordered or ordered list)
		
  <li> Video</li>
		This tag would be helpful if the school website had a video that they wanted to incorporate in it. It could display some news.
		Tag: < video > < / video >
   <li> Break</li>
		This is helpful for formatting the text. 
		Tag: < br > 
		
	<li> Input </li>
		This would be helpful when there is a help-email form. The users  or parents or students can go and email the professor of any issue.
		Tag: < input >< / input >
</ol>  


<h2> CSS: Cascading Style Sheet </h2> 

<p>	Depending on the school's preference on style, one may have to use different font-sizes, font-families,font-weights,colors (for the text). Because there would be
 pictures and text, there would be a need to style the padding, margin-left:,  margin-right: and texts (such as text-align:center, etc.). For the table, one would 
 need to look at the border properties such as width, height , and vertical alignment. The website may also want to have a different background color so one would use
 background-color. 

</p>




<ol><h2>Breakdown:</h2> 
<li> Main page:
	<p> It contains the title of the School and the school's contact information. This contains a banner image for the school. 
	It contains a bus route image along with a table (3 rows x unknown columns). It also contains a table of teachers ( with the three columns).</p>
	</li>
<li> After clicking on a teacher's name (from the column): 
	<p>It opens up to another page via hyperlinked. It displays the teacher's name and a small description of who they are and what they do. It shows a picture of 
	the teacher near the top left. It also contains text about their contact information.  It has link to their syllabus. It also has a table containging the  Assignment 
	information. There would be a bulleted list of the exam times and dates. There could also be a personalized calender image of their entire school schedule; it would
	list the dates of exams and assignments. 
	There would be a link to go back. There would also be a link to go to a "submit an inquiry" page where the input html tag would come in handy. 
	It would allow users  or parents or students can go and email the professor of any issue.
