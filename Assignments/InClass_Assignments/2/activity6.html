Verse:<br>
I think some words are overdue <br>
Could we just do it over?<br>
Can we just talk it out like friends because I need your shoulder?<br>
I know we ended on the wrong terms<br>
But I said we're past it<br>
So why you textin' me with questions you don't gotta ask me?<br>
Like (Hey!)<br>
"I know it's random, how you been?<br>
Do you remember 'bout this band you said you listened to?<br>
While we were younger, while we were softer<br>
While we were all about each other<br>
Hope life is treatin' you better"<br>
Better, better<br>
Girl, what's with that?<br>
Yo', cut the act, 'cause I don't have time for laughs<br>
No, I do not want the past<br>
But if you are ever in need<br>
And God has you down on your knees<br>
And you do not know who to be<br>
Then go on and come home to me<br>
</p>


<p class="chorus"><i>
Chorus:<br>
'Cause I'm here (Hm-whoa)<br>
If you need me, I'll be here (Hm-whoa)<br>
Right here (Hm-whoa)<br>
Said I'm here (Hm-whoa)<br>
If you need me, I'll be here (Hm-whoa)<br>
Right here (Hm-whoa)<br>
Oh

Verse:<br>
And how you likin' this new guy?<br>
I know you always want the new life<br>
I hope he taking care of you like<br>
The way you cared for me in my time (Hey!)<br>
See, you got yourself some new friends<br>
No, you don't need to go to Houston<br>
You got me thinkin' back about then<br>
Girl, I wonder why you textin'<br>
Girl, what's with that?<br>
Yo', cut the act, 'cause I don't have time for laughs<br>
No, I do not want the past<br>
But if you are ever in need<br>
And God has you down on your knees<br>
And you do not know who to be<br>
Then go on and come home to me<br>
